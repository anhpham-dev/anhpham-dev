## Hi there 👋

I’m **AnhPham** - a developer who likes building things that actually work.

I work on:
- 🧩 Minecraft plugins & server systems
- 🤖 Discord bots & automation
- 🌐 Web apps & APIs
- 🎬 Creative tech (video editing, motion graphics, game systems)

I enjoy mixing engineering logic with creative ideas, turning concepts into usable products. Always learning, always shipping, and always improving my craft.
